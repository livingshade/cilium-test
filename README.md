# Cilium track

This repo acts as a summary of Cilium documentation.

## Install

### Prerequisites  

Run `bash ./scripts/deps.sh` to install the dependency if you are using ubuntu. 

Then run `bash ./scripts/k8s_setup.sh` to set up Kubernetes environments, if you are not going to install `kubeproxy-free` version.

### Cilium CNI 

Cilium can be installed using Cilium-cli or Helm. Run `bash ./scripts/cilium_install.sh` to install Cilium. 

You might want to run `cilium connectivity test` as sanity check.

This scripts simple install Cilium CNI. If you want to enable hubble for observability, refer to `Hubble` section.


### Cilium with Istio 

Ciliumâ€™s Istio integration allows Cilium to enforce HTTP L7 network policies for mTLS protected traffic within the Istio sidecar proxies. In that sense, Cilium replace the CNI and possbily observability that originally using by Istio, but still keeps the Istio's powerful L7 traffic management features. [Full document here](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/network/istio/).

Run `bash ./scripts/cilium_istio_install.sh` do that.

### Cilium `kubeproxy-free`

Functionality like L7 policies achieved by Enovy CRD, requires that `kube-proxy` is fully replaced by Cilium. In that case, the installation is quite differenet. [Full document here](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/network/kubernetes/kubeproxy-free/)

Instead of using `k8s_setup.sh`, we need to run `bash ./scripts/cilium_proxyless_install.sh` to both set Kubernates and Cilium environments. Then run the sanity checks to ensure `kube-proxy` is fully replaced.


```bash
kubectl -n kube-system exec ds/cilium -- cilium status | grep KubeProxyReplacement
# expect: KubeProxyReplacement:    Strict  

kubectl exec -it -n kube-system cilium-<your_pod_hash_val> -- cilium service list
# expect something like:
# ID   Frontend               Service Type   Backend
# [...]
# 4    10.104.239.135:80      ClusterIP      1 => 10.217.0.107:80
#                                            2 => 10.217.0.149:80
# 5    0.0.0.0:31940          NodePort       1 => 10.217.0.107:80
#                                            2 => 10.217.0.149:80
# 6    192.168.178.29:31940   NodePort       1 => 10.217.0.107:80
#                                            2 => 10.217.0.149:80
# 7    172.16.0.29:31940      NodePort       1 => 10.217.0.107:80
```

### Hubble

As long as Cilium is installed, you can use `bash ./scripts/hubble.sh` to enable hubble and access its fancy UI. [More details here](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/gettingstarted/hubble/)

### Istio

You might also want to install Istio to reproduce the performance results. Run `bash ./istio_install.sh` to do so.

### Cleanup

I believe the best way is `sudo reboot`.

## Example

We use bookinfo application to show the functionality and performance. To deploy the application:

```bash
kubectl apply -f ./k8s/<your-cluster-setting>/bookinfo-v1.yaml
```

`your-cluster-setting` can be `Cilium` or `Istio`, depends on what you have installed.

## Functionalites

### L3/L4 

Cilium provides some network policies.

### L7

#### North-South 

For ingress and egress traffic, Cilium supports Gateway API.

####  East-West

Cilium supports for L7 traffic management between pods is not as complete as Istio.

## Performance

We use bookinfo-v1 to test the performance.

- Cilium [https://cilium.io/] and its Slack channel.
- Isovalent. There are many blogs that clearly illustrate the architecture about the service mesh. It helps build a high level understanding about Cilium, but somehow lacks codes and toturials. [https://isovalent.com/blog/]
